# Whack-A-Mole
The player has a hammer that they use to hit moles. They will click their mouse on top of the mole to get points for hitting the mole and they will right-click to use the power-ups they have. There is a 1 minuite timer and in that one minuite the user tries to get as many points as they can. As the timer goes down, the moles pop up faster. There are also power ups that the user can get that freeze time, cause all of the moles to come up at once so you can get more points, and more.
